Standardized site-specific variables
------------------------------------

The following variables shall be defined for every site module:

`site_code`:: a simple, unique string indicating the site.
Unless otherwise needed, it is *best* to make this the same as the
submodule name in the `pyqmc.sites.*` namespace.


Internal API
------------

`_detect_sites()`:: returns True if this script runs on a given site
(based on its heuristic detection), False otherwise.


Design issues
-------------

Due to its essential and low-level nature, it is probably wise not to use
fancy bells and whistles from wpylib (e.g., text_input) in order to avoid
problems when those modules are upgraded.



Security and privacy issues
---------------------------

To avoid issues related to divulged host names and specifics of a host,
which could be exploited by hackers, I would use SHA1 digest to detect
host location, as much as I can.
