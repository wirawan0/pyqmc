The class "calc_base" is a base class for any calculation:


  class calc_base(object):
    # Parameters should be stored together
    # as attributes in this class, or as a Parameters()
    # object:
    p = Parameters()
      # Mandatory parameters:
      package = str
        "abinit"
          ixc
          method
        "nwchem"
          method: "UHF", "RHF", "ROHF", "MP2", ...
        "gamess"
        "psi3" (future)
        "mpqc" (ongoing development)
        "gafqmc"
        "pwqmc77"
        # Note that one calculation may require another calculation
        # as its dependency!

    # Mandatory objects:
    def dir(self, ...):
    def scratch_dir(self, ...):
    def large_files_dir(self, ...):
    def run(self, ...):

    def build_system(self):
      # builds the molecule/crystal
      # requires knowledge of atoms, where they are


    # Interactive commands:
    godir(self, **params)


The idea is to allow easier modification of an existing calculation.

Challenges:
* we have a mix of things to specify at different places and must be
  mixed together to compose a complete calculation.
  Example:
    - atoms & positions
    - package (e.g. nwchem)
    - method (e.g. UHF)
    - basis set (e.g. cc-pVTZ or planewave with Ecut=100Ry)
    - site information
    - how to run (batch, immediate, ...)
      serial, parallel, how many processors, etc. -- this is terrible!
      There is currently no way to encapsulate this.

  How to mix these together in a single calculation instance so as to
  get the job done (efficiently) without sacrificing readability and
  flexibility?

* Persistence of states
  - calculation state should be saved to/retrieved from disk
    so as to avoid unnecessary recalculation.
  - calculation state should be tracked using a database.

This class requires the knowledge of site-specific data (such as directory
layout, where it is running, etc).

  class site_base(object):
    # Base dirs are:
    GAFQMC
    PWQMC77
    tbh
    nwchem # (?)
    # ... etc etc
